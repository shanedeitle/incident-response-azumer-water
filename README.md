# Incident Response & Security Remediation – Azumer Water

## Overview
This project analyzes a **cyberattack on Azumer Water**, a public water service provider, and develops an **incident response and remediation plan** to address the identified security failures.  
It delivers a **root cause analysis**, evaluates the **CIA triad impacts**, assesses **FISMA compliance violations**, and provides **recommendations for technical, procedural, and organizational remediation**.

---

## Key Findings
- **Root Cause:**  
  - Lack of **multifactor authentication** for remote administrative access.  
  - **Unpatched critical vulnerabilities** in network-facing systems.  
  - Absence of a **formalized incident response plan**.  

- **CIA Triad Impacts:**  
  - **Confidentiality:** Customer PII and operational data exposure.  
  - **Integrity:** Potential tampering with water treatment control systems.  
  - **Availability:** Service disruptions impacting water distribution.  

- **Regulatory Violations:**  
  - **FISMA Noncompliance**: Inadequate risk management framework implementation.  
  - **NIST SP 800-53 Gaps:** Missing AC (Access Control), IR (Incident Response), and SI (System Integrity) controls.

## Recommendations
### **Technical Controls**
- Implement **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)** for all administrative access.  
- Establish a **patch management program** with automated vulnerability scanning.  
- Segment **operational technology (OT)** from corporate IT networks using firewalls and VLANs.  

### **Procedural Improvements**
- Develop a **NIST SP 800-61–aligned Incident Response Plan (IRP)** with clear escalation paths.  
- Conduct **tabletop exercises** for key staff on cyber incident handling.  
- Create a **Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery Plan** for critical water services.  

### **Organizational Changes**
- Appoint a **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)** to oversee enterprise security.  
- Hire a **Security Operations Manager** to implement monitoring and response procedures.  
- Align IT & OT teams under a unified **cybersecurity governance framework**.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Incident Response Planning (NIST SP 800-61)  
- Regulatory Compliance Analysis (FISMA, NIST SP 800-53)  
- Risk Assessment & Impact Analysis (CIA Triad)  
- Security Governance & Organizational Design  
- Root Cause Analysis & Remediation Planning

## Next Steps
- Add a **visual incident response workflow diagram** (Preparation → Detection → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned).  
- Create an **organizational chart** for the proposed security structure.  
- Map recommendations to **NIST CSF and ISO/IEC 27002** frameworks.
